  description: "This is the second course in the group-based, two-course capstone sequence: ENSC 405W (Capstone A), and ENSC 440 (Capstone B). The capstone design course is based around a group project that consists of researching, designing, building and testing the hardware implementation of a working system. The course also includes material on how to design for safety and a shop training workshop. In order to obtain credit, students must successfully complete both courses. Students may not take Capstone B and Co-op in the same term.",

  title: "Engineering Science Thesis Proposal",
  description: "Supervised study, research and preliminary work leading to a formal proposal for the thesis project work in ENSC 499. This activity can be directly augmented by other course work and by directed study. The locale of the work may be external to the University or within a University laboratory, or may bridge the two locations. Supervision may be by technical personnel at an external organization, or by faculty members, or through some combination. At least one of the supervisors must be a registered professional engineer. A plan for the student's ENSC 498 activities must be submitted to the school at the time of enrolment in the course. Completion of the undergraduate thesis project proposal is the formal requirement of this course and the basis upon which it is graded. Grading will be on a pass/fail basis.",
