  title: "Engineering Science Thesis Proposal",
  description: "Supervised study, research and preliminary work leading to a formal proposal for the thesis project work in ENSC 499. This activity can be directly augmented by other course work and by directed study. The locale of the work may be external to the University or within a University laboratory, or may bridge the two locations. Supervision may be by technical personnel at an external organization, or by faculty members, or through some combination. At least one of the supervisors must be a registered professional engineer. A plan for the student's ENSC 498 activities must be submitted to the school at the time of enrolment in the course. Completion of the undergraduate thesis project proposal is the formal requirement of this course and the basis upon which it is graded. Grading will be on a pass/fail basis.",

  title: "Engineering Science Undergraduate Thesis",
  description: "A thesis is based on the research or  development project that incorporates a significant level of engineering design. This work is typically undertaken in the student's final year, but in no case before the student has completed 115 units. Registration for ENSC 499 takes place in the term in which the thesis will be presented and defended. The locale of the work, supervision and other arrangements follow those for ENSC 498. Grading of the thesis will be on a pass/fail basis, but recognition will be given to outstanding work.",
